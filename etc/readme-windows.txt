SleepArchiver Windows readme


Java

	Program requires Java 1.6.0_10 or latter to run.

	You can check which version you have installed:
		http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre&try=1
	(or by using "java -version" command)

	Java official download site:
		http://java.com/download/


Connector driver

	If you want to use a connection cable to import data from the watch, 
	you should either have a driver bundled with original Sleeptracker 
	software installed, or download driver from FTDI official site:
		http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm


Portable mode
  
	If local "settings" directory exists, program stores all settings 
	in that directory instead of user profile.

	You may also copy "jre" directory of the JRE installation 
	into the program directory to run Java in portable mode.

  
Starting the program

	Run "SleepArchiver.exe" to start the program
	(open "Tutorial.xmz" with the program to see the tutorial).
